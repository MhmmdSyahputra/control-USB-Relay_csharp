The `relay-control` application allows you to control relay devices via the terminal. Here is how to use this application:

## Execute .exe

1. Make sure you are in the directory containing the `relay-control.exe` file.
2. Open a terminal (e.g. Command Prompt or PowerShell).
3. Type the following command to run the application and select the relay device directly from the command line arguments:

     ```plaintext
     .\relay-control.exe <device_index>
     ```

     Replace `<device_index>` with the index number of the relay device you want to select.

## Run the Program

1. Make sure you are in the directory containing the `relay-control.exe` file.
2. Open a terminal (e.g. Command Prompt or PowerShell).
3. Type the following command to run the application:

     ```plaintext
     .\relay-control.exe

     The application will display a list of available relay devices and ask you to select a relay device from the list.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to select the desired relay device by entering the index number.
5. The application will control the selected relay device according to the instructions given.

Be sure to replace `<device_index>` with the index number that corresponds to the relay device you want to use.
